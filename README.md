# portcull
Port Cull. No, the name isn't that accurate, but I couldn't think of a better one. It culls processes... by port.

`portcull` is a Rust util that accepts a port (or list of ports), finds the processes attached to them, and kills them.

## Example Usage
Were you vibe-coding (admit it, you were, we all do sometimes) and your agent left a rogue `node server.js` running, and you want to free that port so you can do... whatever you do on your ports?
Simply run `portcull`!
```bash
$ portcull 3030
Are you sure you want to kill these processes: ["node.exe"]? (y/N): y
Killing processes!
Killed PID 28644 (node.exe)
```
(you can run it with as many ports as you want and it'll attempt to kill processes associated with all of them)

## Installation
Clone the repo and install via `cargo`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chris-3345/portcull.git
cd portcull
cargo install --path .
```

For the above to work, make sure ~/.cargo/bin is in your PATH.

## OS Support/How it works
`portcull` is cross-platform and uses native system commands to find PIDs. On Linux/macOS, it uses lsof. On Windows, it uses netstat and a regex.

**Depending on the ports you are trying to clear, you may need to run `portcull` with admin privileges (e.g., `sudo portcull <ports>` on Linux/Mac or an elevated Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows) so it has permission to look up and kill those processes.**

## Special Features
If `portcull` detects you are trying to kill `ollama`, it remins you that Ollama will immediately restart itself anyway (but it still *attempts* to kill it for you).
